					Isaiah has always been fascinated by technology and knew that he wanted to pursue a career in computer science. So, when it came time to choose a college, he decided to attend one of the best computer science programs in the country.
<p>
					
					John, on the other hand, is more interested in marketing and branding. He wanted to learn how to create compelling campaigns and build strong relationships with customers. So, he decided to attend a top-ranked marketing program at a different university.
					
				<p>
					So, we decided to start our own company, combining Isaiah's expertise in computer science with John's skills in marketing. We work tirelessly to help bring local businesses a greater online presence to better enhance the customer experience online and in person. Our goal 
					is to work closely with local businesses to emphasize the parts of their company that need highlighting.
