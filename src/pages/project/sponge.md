This company is developing a video-based study tool to help students find exactly the content they need to help them with their work. Their goal is to bring creater-generated content to deliver accurate, engaging videos to help students understand and move past the work in front of them.

This company has our work all throughout its core from the logo and color palette to their platform's UI design and website design. Our task was to create a user friendly website to capture feedback from a younger demographic, so we created an easy-to-use site with an inviting feel for students.
